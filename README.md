### What I learned

There's not much I learned while developing the solution for this challenge, it's just that I had to remind myself some stuff I forgot, that's all.

Actually, no, I did learn one thing, and that is, if you use any type of JSX inside one of the `.stories.js` file you have to rename that file to `.stories.jsx` otherwise _there will be a dynamic import error_.

### Continued development

I would've liked to convert the project to typescript, then I would've had a lot of things to learn and also remind myself. However, I read on a github thread that converting an existing Vite project to TS is a bit of a hassle, not impossible, just a bit of a nuissance, so I decided against it.
